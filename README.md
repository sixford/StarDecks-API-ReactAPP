# StarDecks API - GA Project 2


## Description

This was the second project of the course, where we were tasked to build a React application that consumes a public API. The app has several components and includes a router. The public API used was the Star Wars API (SWAPI), and the app serves as an introductory gallery to the prequel and sequel Star Wars films. The project showcases the use of React, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive single-page application (SPA) that allows users to explore the movies in a structured and interactive format.

## Timeframe & Working Team (Pair)

The project was conducted over a strict 2-day deadline, with the first morning dedicated primarily to planning and wireframing. We worked in a pair programming format, which helped us manage the coding process efficiently by allowing us to divide tasks and tackle challenges together. Working alongside Molly was a great experience as we were able to seamlessly integrate our ideas and skills.


## Planning

Initially, we planned to create an encyclopedia-based app that provided detailed information on various aspects of the Star Wars universe. However, due to the nature of the API endpoints and the limited project timeframe, we pivoted to focus specifically on creating a movie explorer that introduces users to the Star Wars films.

# Planning Steps:

Wireframing: We created basic wireframes using a digital tool to map out the structure and layout of the application.

API Exploration: We spent time understanding the available endpoints from the SWAPI to determine which data would be displayed.

Task Allocation: We divided tasks based on our strengths. I focused on setting up the API calls and routing, while my partner handled the styling and component structure.

## Build/Code Process

Day 1: Setup home page and styled quickly. Set up and defined films model with what data we wanted displayed from the Star Wars public API. Tested each endpoint in Insomnia. 

Day 2: Add pages for single films and dedicated afternoon/evening to complex styling such as animations and sounds. Tried to include a 3D background unsuccessfully onto home page. 

## Technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- React
- Bootstrap
- Javascript (ES6)
- React Hooks
- Git
- Github
- Insomnia
- Vite
- Axios
- React router
- SWAPI

## Major hurdles : 

- API didnâ€™t include images
- Single pages
- UseParams()
- Console.logging everything
- Footer not displaying properly on home page
- Background sound
- Tried to include animated video background as stretch goal; changed format of page.

## Wins

- Successfully integrated the SWAPI into a React app with no prior experience.
- Implemented a clean and intuitive navigation structure with React Router.
- Managed to deploy a fully functional and visually appealing application within the 2-day deadline.
- Improved collaboration skills through effective communication and task management during pair programming.
- Incorporated some innovative animations such as moving text in the style of Star Wars and carousels with sound effects which really added to the theme of the project.

## Key Learnings/Takeaways

- React & React Router: Gained confidence in using React Hooks and React Router for building SPAs.
- API Integration: Improved skills in consuming and managing data from a public API.
- Pair Programming: Learned the value of clear communication and task delegation in a collaborative environment.
- Time Management: Developed better time management skills by working within a strict project deadline and prioritizing key features.
